                <h2>Prepaid Debit Card</h2>
                <p>Virtual Visa is a prepaid debit card that allows customers to purchase items at international merchants by topping up their Virtual Visa card in the Wave app. Popular merchants include Netflix, Spotify, App Store, and Play Store. For a lot of our customers, this is their first time interacting with a debit card. A Support Lead at Wave mentioned "Finally, we can join the global economy."</p>

                <h2>Card Functionality</h2>
                <p>Customers can tap the copy icon to copy their card number and paste it into a website's checkout page. They can also show and hide their card details by tapping the hide/show eye icon. The 16 digits, EXP, and CVV default to a hidden state to keep customer's information private. Customers can also lock their card to prevent additional charges to the debit card.</p>

            <h2>Foreign Exchange Converter</h2>
            <p>In the table below the card, there are 3 actions customers can take:</p>

            <ul class="case-study-list">
                <li>Estimate the cost of their purchases with the Currency Converter</li>
                <li>Lock their card</li>
                <li>Go to Settings to delete their card</li>
           </ul>
           <p>Customer can enter an amount in EUR or USD to get an accurate estimation for how much CFA (Western African Francs) they'll need to have loaded on the prepaid debit card before their purchase. If they don't have enough, they can recharge the card.</p>

            <p>With Claude's help in February 2025, I created a vibecoded iOS prototype that I was able to test with real customers when I visited Abidjan in April 2025.</p>

            <p>8 out of 10 times, a Figma prototype has enough high fidelity feedback with tap, drag, and swipe interactions to test our bets quickly. However, we needed something with higher fidelity interactions, like accurate and fast number input and calculation feedback. After a few versions, a lot of polishing (because I am a designer at heart), and some wrangling with AppStore approvals, I got the external TestFlight up and running for the FX Currency Converter feature.</p>

            <p>Firing up Xcode and going back and forth with Claude was both fun and frustrating as someone who had never opened Xcode before. I'm blown away by how far LLMs have come in a short amount of time. Since then, I've created 4 more iOS prototypes with the help of both ChatGPT o3 and Claude to test more complicated design interactions with customers.</p>
